<p>A <strong>Yes</strong> means that you will be attending the hackathon. If you are coming to the event, select this option. Please only select yes if you are attending the event. If you select yes and do not attend, not only will you deny another hacker an opportunity to participate, but it may have implications on your acceptance to future RevolutionUC hackathons. A <strong>No</strong> means that you will not be attending the event. If you have teammates who have not received the option to confirm their attendance, please first choose <strong>Yes</strong> below, then email <a href="mailto:info@revolutionuc.com">info@revolutionuc.com</a> with their names and emails.</p>

<p>
  <center>
    <button class="large secondary expanded" href="{{ yesConfirmationUrl if yesConfirmationUrl else 'https://example.com/' | safe }}" target="_blank">Yes - I’m attending RevolutionUC</button>
  </center>
</p>

<p>
  <center>
    <button class="large success expanded" href="{{ noConfirmationUrl if noConfirmationUrl else 'https://example.com/' | safe }}" target="_blank">No - I’m not attending RevolutionUC</button>
  </center>
</p>

<p>If you select <strong>Yes</strong>, you will receive a welcome email with info for the day of the event.</p>

<p>Note: if you do not confirm your attendance within a few days then your spot will automatically be given to a hacker on the waitlist.</p>

<p><strong>What if I confirm my attendance now and later can’t attend?</strong><br />
Please send us an email at <a href="mailto:info@revolutionuc.com">info@revolutionuc.com</a> ASAP to release your spot. If you confirm your attendance and don’t show there could be penalties on attending a future RevolutionUC.</p>

<p><strong>I accidently selected No!</strong><br />
Please email us immediately at <a href="mailto:info@revolutionuc.com">info@revolutionuc.com</a>. If you selected no and can later attend, we’ll do our best, but please understand that we may have no remaining space.</p>
