<p>We’re excited to have you at RevolutionUC! Because you’re under 18, there is some extra information you need to know to get ready. Following these guidelines is mandatory, and necessary for compliance with university guidelines.</p>

<p><strong>Waiver and Communication Information</strong><br />
Parents/guardians will be able contact hackathon organizers with questions or concerns during the event. The primary contact for questions related to minors at the event is Laura Tebben, who can be reached at (740) 415-8890. Questions can also be asked prior to the event via email at <a href="mailto:info@revolutionuc.com">info@revolutionuc.com</a>. Parents/Guardians are also welcome to contact their participant at any time during the event by phone, email, etc.</p>

<p>On the waiver, we ask that you list two emergency contacts. We’ll need the name, email address, phone number, and relationship of each contact.</p>

<p>In the event of an emergency, we will notify your primary emergency contact. If we cannot reach your primary contact, we will notify your secondary emergency contact.</p>

<p>Emergency contact information will be collected using the waiver linked below. The waiver requires a parent or guardian signature. Please make sure to download this specific version of the waiver; it is not the same waiver that is given to over 18 participants. Submission of the waiver and forms at check in is mandatory for participation.</p>

<p><strong>Dedicated Hackerspace</strong><br />
The event will be taking place primarily on the 800 floor of Rhodes Hall, in the 801 suite. We will also be using rooms 860D and 860B. Although all of these areas will be considered a part of the hackerspace, as a minor, your workspace will be in 860D. This effort will ensure we can offer mandated supervision for all minors.</p>

<p>The address for Rhodes Hall is 2901 Woodside Dr, Cincinnati OH 45221. If you need help finding rhodes hall from the parking options available there, you can find a complete map of campus <a href="https://www.uc.edu/content/dam/uc/af/pdc/maps/maps_2016_2017/2016-2017%20UC%20Uptown%20West%20Campus.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Leaving and Re-Entering the Event</strong><br />
If you want to leave during the event, you must either be signed out by your parent/guardian, or be pre-approved by your parent/guardian on the above waiver. If you are not pre-approved, then your parent/guardian must also sign you back in. This includes if you wish to leave before the event concludes. If under 18 and leaving, you must sign out with the designated hackathon organizer in the 860D suite before leaving, and sign back in upon return if returning.</p>

<p><strong>Pick-up and Drop-off</strong><br />
If you’re not driving to the event, you can be dropped off in ERC Circle at 2901 Woodside Dr, Cincinnati OH 45221. This is also where you can be picked up after the event. If you wish to leave early, you will require a guardian’s signature; they will need to sign you out in Rhodes 860D.</p>

<p>We look forward to hacking with you!</p>
